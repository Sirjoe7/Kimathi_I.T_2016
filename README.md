# Git Workflow
If you're on Windows, please download and install the git framework on your machine.
You can download the git setup from the following links:

64 bit Windows OS : https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.17.0.windows.1/Git-2.17.0-64-bit.exe
32 bit Windows OS : https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.17.0.windows.1/Git-2.17.0-32-bit.exe

For most linux distros it comes pre-configured. But if it isn't then type "apt-get install git" on your terminal.
